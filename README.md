# AnvilParser

This project is yet another parser for the [Minecraft Anvil file format](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Anvil_file_format) (.mca), which is used to store Minecraft worlds. The main considerations were performance and a broad range of supported versions. Currently only read operations are supported.

## Supported versions

All versions between 1.7.10 and 1.20.4 are supported, other versions may or may not work.

## Disclaimer

This project is a partial port of [anvil-parser](https://github.com/0xTiger/anvil-parser), which was written in Python. Huge thanks to [@0xTiger](https://github.com/0xTiger) for maintaining that project!
